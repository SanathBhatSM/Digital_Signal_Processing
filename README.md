# Digital_Signal_Processing 
This repository contains laboratory experiments of the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Lab as per the VTU Curriculum with the subject code 18ECL57. The experiments are conducted using MATLAB and a DSP kit in C programming.

## MATLAB Experiments

1. Verification of Sampling Theorem (Using Interpolation Function)
2. Linear and Circular Convolution of Sequences, Convolution Properties
3. Auto and Cross-Correlation of Sequences, Property Verification
4. Solution of Difference Equations
5. Computation of N-Point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with Magnitude and Phase Spectrum Plotting
6. (i) Verification of DFT Properties (e.g., Linearity, Parseval's Theorem)
   (ii) DFT Computation of Square Pulse and Sinc Function
7. Design and Implementation of Low-Pass and High-Pass FIR Filters Using Different Window Techniques, Audio Signal Filtering, and Spectrum Analysis
8. Design and Implementation of Digital IIR Filters (Low-Pass and High-Pass), Audio Signal Filtering, and Spectrum Analysis

## DSP Kit Experiments (C Programming)

9. Linear Convolution of Sequences
10. Circular Convolution of Sequences
11. Computation of N-Point DFT
12. Determination of Impulse Response for First and Second-Order Systems
13. Generation of Sine Waves and Standard Test Signals

These experiments cover a wide range of DSP concepts and provide practical insights into digital signal processing techniques.
